# The gh-pr-scm macro should be used alongside gh-pr-builder. It will only checkout the PR 
# contributor's repository and branch. This changes the default behaviour of the plugin 
# which attempts to merge changes with a base branch ('master' in our case). This is a 
# workaround for the following issue: https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-35170
